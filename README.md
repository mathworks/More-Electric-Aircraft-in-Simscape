This submission demonstrates modeling of a more-electric aircraft architecture in Simscape, for both desktop and real-time simulation.
The model shows how different physical domains may be interconnected and simulated at different sample times,
and how Simscape model segments may be converted to standalone FMU components.

Open the project file 'MEA.prj'.

Navigate to the 'Project Shortcuts' tab to find one-click links to the models.

Open the slide deck in the 'Slides' directory for further information and to work through the examples as appropriate.
